RAMDISKU - Ramdisk Driver for
SpartaDOS 3

RAMCARTU Dn: [/EDF]

RAMCARTU is a ramdisk driver for
SpartaDOS and RAMBO compatible RAM
extensions from 64k to 1024k. It is
derived form the original
RD Ver 2.3 07-14-86 by FTe delivered
originally with SpartaDOS 3. The
main difference is that tfhh 512k
SRAM, Rambo 1024k, and Compy Shop
512k (e.g.Ultimate1MB) are supported
in addition.

Dx: specifies the drive
number n that should be used for the
ramdisk. With option /D the only the
ramdisk driver will be installed.
With option /F the ramdisk will only
be formatted. Without any
option the ramdisk will be
formatted on demand. The option /E
spares the first 4 banks to be
compatible with 130XE and programs
that uses the extended memory. This
only works if the Basic bit (1) of
PORTB is not used or you only work
without Basic (always Basic off).

RAMDISKU can be simultaneously used 
with RAMCART.
